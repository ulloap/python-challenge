I had much difficulty figuring out how to save key from Git, as well as committing and pushing back to Git. I would like to thank "AskBCSLearningAssisstant" on Slack for the pointers, as well as a website with the url of "https://www.jcchouinard.com/create-your-first-github-project-in-vscode/#:~:text=Click%20on%20the%20Source%20Control,to%20your%20remote%20GitHub%20repository." 

In order to successfully transfer my file over to the analysis page, the website https://flexiple.com/python/python-new-line was great help in learning how to skip to the next row. 

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37686105/python-splitting-data-as-columns-in-csv-file was much help in PyPoll in ways to seperate my candidates. As well as https://github.com/JovaniPink/election-analysis/blob/master/PyPoll.py was a very helpful source to help me organize my code better.

Most of all, ChatGPT had very detailed and helpful answers to my questions.
